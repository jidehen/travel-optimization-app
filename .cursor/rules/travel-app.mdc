Travel Agent Optimization App - Python Development Guide (CLI Version)

🌟 Project Overview & Context
What We're Building
A sophisticated AI-powered travel optimization system that automatically finds the best combination of flights and payment methods to maximize customer rewards and savings. The system uses multiple specialized MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers orchestrated by an intelligent agent to deliver personalized travel recommendations via CLI interaction.
Business Problem We're Solving
Current Pain Point: Customers with multiple Chase credit cards struggle to optimize their travel purchases. They don't know which card to use for which flight to maximize rewards, cashback, or points. This leads to:

Suboptimal reward earning (leaving money on the table)
Decision paralysis when booking travel
Poor customer engagement with premium card benefits
Missed opportunities for Chase to demonstrate card value

Our Solution: An intelligent agent that automatically:

Searches available flights for user's travel needs
Analyzes user's payment methods and available credit
Calculates rewards/benefits for each flight+payment combination
Ranks recommendations by total value (price + rewards optimization)
Explains the reasoning behind each recommendation

Technical Innovation & Architecture
🎯 Why This Architecture Matters:
MCP Protocol Showcase: We're building a cutting-edge implementation of the Model Context Protocol, demonstrating how AI agents can orchestrate multiple specialized services to solve complex optimization problems.
Domain-Driven Microservices: Each MCP server represents a distinct business domain:

Chase Travel MCP Server: Flight search and travel data
SafePay Wallet MCP Server: Payment methods and account information
Benefits MCP Server: Card rewards, multipliers, and benefits
Optimization MCP Server: Intelligent recommendation engine

Agent Orchestration: A Smart SDK agent coordinates all MCP servers to deliver a unified, intelligent experience that feels like talking to a travel expert who knows your financial products intimately.
